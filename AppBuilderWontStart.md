## App Builder won't start

### App icon on desktop when clicked does not start SAB <a id="h2-4"></a>



This is not an SAB issue but rather a computer issue where .jar files are associated with nothing or another program.



#### Here are some solutions



* Instead of the shortcut pointing to the .jar file, change the link so it points to the sab.bat file.

* You can force your registry to point to your java installation. See the jar-fix-reg.cmd. You must run this command prompt as Administrator. This process creates a backup file of your registration entry so it is easy to Merge the old entry back if something else breaks. It asks two questions about merging. Answer Yes to each one.

* There are various FixJava programs available on the internet.
